📸 Fast Photo Sorter ⚡

Sort your photos at the speed of light (or at least, the speed of your thumb).

Tired of dragging and dropping files? Drowning in a sea of "DSC_0001.jpg"?

This app turns the boring chore of organizing photos into a high-speed game. It's like Tinder for your files—but instead of a date, you get a clean hard drive.

🚀 How It Works

Select a Folder: Pick the chaotic folder you want to tame.

The Image Pops Up: Big, clear, and ready for judgment.

Press a Key:

👉 Right Arrow = "GOOD" (Keeper!)

👈 Left Arrow = "DELETE" (Trash it... safely!)

👆 Up Arrow = "MAYBE" (I have commitment issues)

The app automatically creates three folders (Good, Maybe, Delete) and shoots the files into them instantly. No dragging. No clicking. Just pure speed.

✨ Features

Keyboard Warrior Friendly: Keep your hands on the keyboard. No mouse needed.

Safe "Deletion": We don't actually delete your files. We move them to a Delete folder so you can panic-check them later.

Duplicate Destroyer: If photo.jpg already exists, we auto-rename the new one to photo_1.jpg. No crashes.

Tkinter Power: Built with Python's native GUI library. It's ugly but it's fast.

🛠️ Installation & Usage

Go to the dist folder inside your project directory.

Find photo_sorter.exe.

Double click it.

Profit.

🐛 Troubleshooting

"The buttons disappeared!": Resize the window slightly, they are shy. (Just kidding, fixed in v1.1).
